## Code Me A Story
A program never needs to look beautiful for it to do what you want it to do. As long as it gets the job done, you can call it a day, right? While it's true that code doesn't need to look the part, it works better if there is some backbone to keep dependencies in line; to allow functions to flow through the code without throwing warnings; to keep redundant code from mucking up the runtime. I had a professor tell the class once that code should tell a story. There should be characters (variables) and events (functions) that help move the story (program) along in a way that makes sense.
