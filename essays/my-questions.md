## To Ask, Or Not To Ask

Throughout most of our education, starting from grade school and all through the collegiate level, you hear teachers and professors say things like "Don't be afraid to ask questions!" or "There's no such thing as a dumb/bad/stupid question!" They say these things because questions are important. Asking those who may have more experience on something will most likely lead you to being able to solve whatever problem is in your way. Now, in regards to there being no dumb/bad/stupid questions, this can get a little twisted depending on the what, who, and where you are posing the question. Sure, there may be no such thing as a bad question when dealing with fundamentals or basic concepts, but what about when we come across a broad or complex issue? What if we are encountering errors while trying to setup a virtual machine on our computer? Simply asking the question "How do I configure *this and that*" will most likely get you nothing. There is a subtle art to asking questions that is invaluable, especially for those working in technical fields.

Knowing how to ask a "smart" question will most likely get you a "smart" answer.

## Stack Overflow: The Good and The Bad

Most of us have heard of Stack Overflow, the question-and-answer site for programmers looking for technical expertise. It is a wonderful resource that should definitely be taken advantage of when you stumble across an issue or just want to see how others handle similar situations.
