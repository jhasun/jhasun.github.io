## Code Me A Story
A program never needs to look beautiful for it to do what you want it to do. As long as it gets the job done, you can call it a day, right? While it's true that code doesn't need to look the part, it works better if there is some backbone to keep dependencies in line, to allow functions to flow through the code without throwing warnings, and to keep redundant code from mucking up the runtime. I once had a professor tell the class that code should tell a story. There should be characters (variables) and events (functions) that help move the story (program) along in a way that makes sense. 

It wouldn't make sense for a story to invest time into defining a character just for that character to never show up again. It goes the same for variables in code. Likewise, for story driving events. A good story shouldn't have random or redundant events that contribute nothing. Code should follow similar principles: redundant or useless functions do nothing but slow your code down, even if it is only by a little. Simple structure like this can vastly improve code, especially as it expands to thousands of lines of code.
