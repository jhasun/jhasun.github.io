### I. Introduction
Artificial intelligence has been integrating itself into society within the recent years, and it has undeniably become a powerful tool at every level. Professionals, educators, students, and many more occupations have benefited from AI. Especially in the field of software engineering, AI has become a "coding assistant" of sorts for many people. Whether AI is being used to write code, check for errors and redundancies, or explain a concept, the potential for AI as an integral part of software engineering seems unlimited. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Google Gemini have all proved to be useful in creating efficient and interactive projects.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18\
To experience and gain the necessary knowledge, I did not employ AI into the Experience WODs. These WODs are meant to provide the fundamentals of the specified area or skill, which means that to fully understand        them, I wanted to go through the content with minimal assistance. If I could not complete the WOD, there were enough resources supplied from the course to help me finish the task.
  2. In-class Practice WODs\
Similar to the experience WODs, I used the in-class practice WODs to develop problem solving skills while under time pressure. The in-class practice WODs didn't hold any weight in terms of grade, therefore I figured I could use them to purely practice my own skills and not rely on AI.
