## Why Did I Take Interest in Software Engineering?

Since I was little I always had an interest in creating things. Like a lot of other children, I played a lot with Lego's and those wooden building blocks that you could make structures with. As I got older and got my hands on new ways to express creativity and problem solving, those toys and hobbies manifeseted themselves into an interest in Engineering. At first, I thought I wanted to pursue Civil Engineering, Architecture, or Electrical Engineering. However, as I went deeper into my college career, I took more classes that involved small programming portions and I realized I enjoyed working with computers more than circuits and physical properties. 

The potential of being able to _virtually_ create and do anything within a computer is just an incredible idea to me, which is why I want to pursue the field and develop not only myself as a Software Engineer, but also contribute to the community with the applications and software that I could create and/or help create.
