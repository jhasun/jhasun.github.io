## Why Did I Take Interest in Software Engineering?

Since I was little I always had an interest in creating things. Like a lot of other children, I played a lot with Lego's and those wooden building blocks that you could make structures with. As I got older and got my hands on new ways to express creativity and problem solving, those toys and hobbies manifeseted themselves into an interest in Engineering. At first, I thought I wanted to pursue Civil Engineering, Architecture, or Electrical Engineering. However, as I went deeper into my college career, I took more classes that involved small programming portions and I realized I enjoyed working with computers more than circuits and physical properties. 

The potential of being able to _virtually_ create and do anything within a computer is just an incredible idea to me, which is why I want to pursue the field and develop not only myself as a Software Engineer, but also contribute to the community with the applications and software that I could create and/or help create.

## Insight Into My Future

In the past, I have gained knowledge and experience in a few languages such as Python, C, C++, and Javascript. While I don't think knowing a lot of programming languages is the biggest way to evaluate yourself as a software engineer, I do think it is helpful. Another "language" I have started to work on is Swift, which is the Apple developed language to assist in app development.

As someone who doesn't yet have any professional experience in the field of Software Engineering, I would hope to develop some professional experience through some internship opportunities. For the time being, I am currently taking a Software Engineering course where I hope to learn more about the field on a semi-professional to professional level as well as developing my own portfolio with projects and achievements. Aside from developing a professional persona, something else I would like to focus on is software development and app design. I would also like to gain experience in User Interface/User Experience design (UI/UX) in order to cover more front-end development.
