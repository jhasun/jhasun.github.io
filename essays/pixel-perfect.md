## Our Framework Floaties

**Splash!** You're thrown into the deep end of the pool and have no idea how to swim. What do you do? Probably splash and thrash your body around trying to get a grip on something to help keep you from sinking. Then, once you've gotten a hold of yourself, you hoist your body out and never step near a body of water again. Well, maybe you don't completely give up on swimming, but you get the point. Learning to swim for the first time can be a very scary experience, especially if you're thrown into the deep end. It's terrifying, and can sometimes have the inverse effect of making you want to stay away from bodies of water. That is why we have these wonderful tools called floaties. They provide a foundation for you to learn how to swim and float all on your own. But wait, why am I talking about swimming and floaties? What does any of this have to do with **"Pixel Perfect Design"**? Well, programmers have floaties too, and they are called frameworks.

Frameworks are a programmers tools that help keep us afloat amidst the languages and different syntax. They provide a structure and foundation to allow us to build entire websites and applications upon. However, they aren't as simple as throwing floaties on and instantly staying afloat. There is still some work to be done to be able to understand how to properly swim through the all the elements, classes, functions, etc.

I just started using my own framework floaties not too long ago for interactive web design, and I really appreciate the functionality that it provides. I began using HTML and CSS, and while it wasn't a horrible experience trying to design websites with the raw languages, it did leave a lot to be desired in terms of built-in classes. It was like a double-edged sword, where I had a lot of power to fully customize every aspect within my website, however I didn't know where to start due to the open-ended nature of raw HTML and CSS. Once I imported the Bootstrap 5 framework, however, and started to design with that wrapped around me, I realized how much easier it can be when there is some foundation to start with. Yes, using a framework such as Bootstrap still has you learning the nuances of it, but once you are able to grasp those you can really start to sail. It just takes a little commitment and investment of your time and effort, but that's just a small payoff to the results that you can produce once you've gotten a hang of it.
