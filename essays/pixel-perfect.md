## Our Framework Floaties

**Splash!** You're thrown into the deep end of the pool and have no idea how to swim. What do you do? Probably splash and thrash your body around trying to get a grip on something to help keep you from sinking. Then, once you've gotten a hold of yourself, you hoist your body out and never step near a body of water again. Well, maybe you don't completely give up on swimming, but you get the point. Learning to swim for the first time can be a very scary experience, especially if you're thrown into the deep end. It's terrifying, and can sometimes have the inverse effect of making you want to stay away from bodies of water. That is why we have these wonderful tools called floaties. They provide a foundation for you to learn how to swim and float all on your own. But wait, why am I talking about swimming and floaties? What does any of this have to do with **"Pixel Perfect Design"**? Well, programmers have floaties too, and they are called Frameworks.

Frameworks are a programmers tools that help keep us afloat amidst the languages and syntax. They provide a structure and foundation to allow us to build entire websites and applications upon. However, they aren't as simple as throwing floaties on and instantly staying afloat. There is still some work to be done to be able to understand how to properly swim through the all the elements, classes, functions, etc.
