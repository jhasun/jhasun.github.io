## Dear Younger Self,
Over the past 4 months, we've been working a lot on our skills as software engineers, and we can finally say that we have just established the fundamentals! I know, it may not seem like a grand leap in our software engineering journey, but developing a solid foundation is what will support us throughout our career. There's much more that goes into being a software engineer than we initially thought, like following professional coding standards, utilizing design patterns to be more efficient, and understanding project management to ensure things get done properly within teams.

Skills such as these, while they may not seem like they would spur us into the industry, could carry us into a thriving and reliable career. They act as a mold to shape us into not only software engineers, but also excellent professional within the industry.

### Storytelling is Key
As a software engineer, we want to create all kinds of cool things that would make our lives easier. Need a program or algorithm that helps automates tasks? What about a game to keep us entertained throughout those boring stretches throughout our day? How about an application or website that gives the public access to convenient tools or information? Software engineers work to turn these concepts and ideas into reality (or virtual reality) so that everyone else can live easier and less stressed. 

However, writing the code to fulfill such dreams are not as easy or stressless as the final product that users get to experience. It can be grueling and frustrating, leaving us software engineers to deal with the nitty gritty aspects. That's why there are coding standards amongst professionals. Coding is akin to a story: characters and variables can help lead the way through the plot and code, allowing us to identify the who, what, where, why, and how. Writing within the lines of a coding standard helps us to not only write readable code for future software engineers, but it also makes us better programmers.

### You got a Problem? We got the Patterns!
Many software engineers have come before us, and it would be a shame to let their experiences go to waste. Design patterns are a way of passing down the experiences and solutions that other developers have encountered. We can use those design patterns as a guiding light to help us navigate through the vast sea of uncharted code. They act as blueprints from the past that we can use to guide us in building our grand design.

Several such design patterns are the "Singleton", the "Observer", the "Module", and the "Facade". We've unkowingly used several of these in projects already, and learning more about them in full gives us more insight into their applications and how they turn our code from a run down town to a thriving cityscape.
