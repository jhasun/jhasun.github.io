### Dear Younger Self,
Over the past 4 months, we've been working a lot on our skills as software engineers, and we can finally say that we have just established the fundamentals! I know, it may not seem like a grand leap in our software engineering journey, but developing a solid foundation is what will support us throughout our career. There's much more that goes into being a software engineer than we initially thought, like following professional coding standards, utilizing design patterns to be more efficient, and understanding project management to ensure things get done properly within teams.

Skills such as these, while they may not seem like they would spur us into the industry, could carry us into a thriving and reliable career. They act as a mold to shape us into not only software engineers, but also excellent professional within the industry.
