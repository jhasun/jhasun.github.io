Authors: Braeden Mendoza, Jay Suh, Kaelen Valencia, Hailey Fagaragan, Yilamu Lafeier, Joshua Asuncion, Luis Hernandez

## Overview
***The Problem***: College is a busy and stressful place filled with anxiety. Especially for those with a busy schedule or are introverted, meeting up with new people and making friends can be very difficult. Dating apps and friend apps tend to have people in all scopes of life as well, leaving little room for relatability and lots of scheduling conflicts for studentsâ€™ busy lives.

***The Solution***: To create an app or website that facilitates finding new people to hang out with or possibly date specifically for UH Manoa students.

## Approach
Based on users interests, creates a list of candidates that are suitable for the user. Ie. recommends other users that they might be interested in. If the user is interested in this person, they can click on their profile and set up a meeting.
