## Rainbows On Speed Dial
Authors: Braeden Mendoza, Jay Suh, Kaelen Valencia, Hailey Fagaragan, Yilamu Lafeier, Joshua Asuncion, Luis Hernandez

## Overview
***The Problem***: College is a busy and stressful place filled with anxiety. Especially for those with a busy schedule or are introverted, meeting up with new people and making friends can be very difficult. Dating apps and friend apps tend to have people in all scopes of life as well, leaving little room for relatability and lots of scheduling conflicts for students’ busy lives.

***The Solution***: To create an app or website that facilitates finding new people to hang out with or possibly date specifically for UH Manoa students.

## Approach
Based on users interests, creates a list of candidates that are suitable for the user. Ie. recommends other users that they might be interested in. If the user is interested in this person, they can click on their profile and set up a meeting.

## Mockup Page Ideas
<ul>
  <li>Landing Page</>
  <li>User Profile Page</>
  <li>Signup Page</>
  <li>Interests/Prompts Page</>
</ul>

## Use Case Ideas
<ul>
  <li>New user goes to the landing page, signs up with UH Manoa ID, and sets up a profile.</>
  <li>During profile setup, you can specify interests, major, whether you’re looking for a friend or romantic relationship.</>
  <li>Admins can login, go to the landing page, and edit or moderate the site.</>
  <li>Users login and return to the landing page, with results posted relating to their specifications during the signup process.</>
  <li>Users can “swipe” on other accounts to show interest, which notify the other user who can then reply if they are interested or not.</li>
</ul>

## Beyond the Basics
<ul>
  <li>A feature where both parties agree to meet in public places on the campus before being allowed to chat. The times and places will be restricted for safety by the application.</>
  <li>After the meeting, the parties can anonymously agree if they wish to continue interacting and then they unlock a messaging feature.</>
  <li>Personality prompts to humanize users and simplify their account description</>
  <li>Feedback or rating system: After</>
</ul>
