## Overview
The University of Hawai'i at Manoa has a wide range of over 200 clubs and organizations available to members of the UH community, however there is no convenient way for them to view or access these clubs online. The Manoa Club Connect project is a web application meant to bridge this gap, allowing those who are apart of the UH community to view the different clubs as well as personalize what type of clubs suit their interests. Users are also able to view the raw list of clubs in alphabetical order as well as look at the clubs by their category. Each club also has a description or purpose that users can read to see if they are interested. The key pages implemented in the website are the Landing Page, the User Profile Page, and Explore Club Page. These pages are displayed below:
