The FitBook application is an online and mobile notebook specifically for assisting people with their fitness goals by keeping track of progress as well as introducing new exercises for those who are just starting out. It is meant to be helpful for all ranges of expertise, from those starting out their fitness journey to those who are trying to break their limits.

FitBook is implemented using Swift, a general purpose programming language and developer tool created by Apple. Throught his project I was able to gain experience in app development, the Software Development Life Cycle, and UI/UX design.

## Future Updates

As the application is still a work in progress and is not a full implementation of the initial design, it still has much work to be done to be able to host all of the utilities that are planned for it.

Included in future updates to the application are tools such as a notebook to keep track of workouts, a timer, a calorie counter, and more as the application gets updated.
