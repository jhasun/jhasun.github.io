The FitBook application is an online and mobile notebook specifically for assisting people with their fitness goals by keeping track of progress as well as introducing new exercises for those who are just starting out. It is meant to be helpful for all ranges of expertise, from those starting out their fitness journey to those who are trying to break their limits.

FitBook is implemented using Swift, a general purpose programming language and developer tool created by Apple. Throught his project I was able to gain experience in app development and UI/UX design.
