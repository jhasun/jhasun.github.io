summary: "Basketball championship for a club team at the Ewa Mahiko Gym grand opening."
---

I was a part of a basketball team from Ewa Asing park on O'ahu, Hawai'i that played in and won the championship in the Ewa Mahiko Gym grand opening.

While not being a technical achievement, this experience did allow me to develop excellent team work and management skills as I held one of the more lead roles for the players on the team. The experience also forced me to work hard to achieve a difficult goal in a competetive scene, which I believe to be extremely useful for the field of software engineering with how competetive it can be. 

The team that I was on that won this championship is shown below.
