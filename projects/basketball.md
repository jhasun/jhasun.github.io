summary: "Basketball championship for a club team at the Ewa Mahiko Gym grand opening."
---

I was a part of a basketball team from Ewa Asing park on O'ahu, Hawai'i that played in and won the championship in the Ewa Mahiko Gym grand opening.

While not being a technical achievement, this experience did allow me to develop excellent team work and management skills as I held one of the more lead roles for the players on the team. The experience also forced me to work hard to achieve a difficult goal in a competetive scene, which I believe to be extremely useful for the field of software engineering with how competetive it can be. 

This also spurred me to seek further challenges at the next level, which was the High School Varsity team. Through all the experience I had gained from training and developing myself while aiming for the club championship, I was able to step up to the next level and play for the Varsity team at my local high school in Kapolei. I believe that this can translate into valuable skills outside of the scope of sports; teamwork and communication, a thirst for being better at a craft, and a competetive spirit to stay ahead.
