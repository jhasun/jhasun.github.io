summary: "Basketball championship for a club team at the Ewa Mahiko Gym grand opening."
---

I was a part of a basketball team from Ewa Asing park on O'ahu, Hawai'i that played in and won the championship in the Ewa Mahiko Gym grand opening.

This experience allowed me to develop excellent team work and management skills as I held one of the more lead roles for the players on the team. As a leader of the team, I had to keep a calm head in stressful situations throughout the game(s) as well as perform above the standards. It also taught me that being a leader doesn't only mean to be the only one performing, it also means that you need to work to elevate everyone else around you to a higher level. The experience forced me to work hard to achieve a difficult goal in a competetive scene, which I believe to be extremely useful for the field of software engineering with how competetive it can be. It also allowed me to develop as a potential leader in the technical field who can direct and manage projects in a team, which is another essential skill to have. 

This also spurred me to seek further challenges at the next level, which was the High School Varsity team. Through all the experience I had gained from training and developing myself while aiming for the club championship, I was able to step up to the next level and play for the Varsity team at my local high school in Kapolei. I believe that this can translate into valuable skills outside of the scope of sports; teamwork and communication, a thirst for being better at a craft, and a competetive spirit to stay ahead.
